* (My (@fzyzcjy's) PRs are not listed here)

## 2.0.0-dev.3

* Please refer to https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/guides/miscellaneous/whats-new for what's changed in V2.
* This is still a separate version to see whether the readme image layout works for pub.dev and crates.io.

## 2.0.0-dev.2

* Please refer to https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/guides/miscellaneous/whats-new for what's changed in V2.
* This is again a separate version, because I need to trigger the `release` CI to fix the binary for `cargo binstall` (
  that CI did not checkout recursive submodule before).

## 2.0.0-dev.1

* Please refer to https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/guides/miscellaneous/whats-new for what's changed in V2.
* This is a separate version, because cargo publish seems not to understand frb_codegen's template Cargo.toml files, so
  need to publish version to test.

## 2.0.0-dev.0

* Please refer to https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/guides/miscellaneous/whats-new for what's changed in V2.
* The 2.0.0-dev.0 will contain bugs and missing features, because I have to have a real (pre-)release before I can start
  working on the last part of tests and functionalities. So it is a chicken-and-egg problem ;) But I expect
  2.0.0-dev.2 (or -dev.3) to be stable.
