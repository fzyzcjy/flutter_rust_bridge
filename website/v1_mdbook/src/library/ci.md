# Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

The CI/CD detailed here, using GitHub Actions, automates a lot of the busy work
that you would otherwise need to maintain your library. These workflows include:

- Automatic dependency updates with dependabot
- Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Unit tests and code checks on pushes/PRs to `main`
  - Integration tests on real & emulated devices on pushes/PRs to `main`
- Continuous Deployment (CD)
  - Manual version/release creation with Melos through a workflow dispatch
    - You can set this up to be automated, but in most cases you _don't_ want a new release on every commit to main
  - Automated publishing of new versions to GitHub releases and pub.dev

## Dependabot (`/.github/dependabot.yaml`)

It is highly recommended that you set up dependabot to automatically submit PRs when
your dependencies fall out of date.

Replace `library_name` below with your library name.

```yaml
version: 2
enable-beta-ecosystems: true
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: pub
    directory: "/packages/library_name"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
  - package-ecosystem: pub
    directory: "/packages/library_name/example"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
  - package-ecosystem: pub
    directory: "/packages/flutter_library_name"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
  - package-ecosystem: pub
    directory: "/packages/flutter_library_name/example"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
  - package-ecosystem: cargo
    directory: "/packages/library_name/native"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
```

## Continuous Integration (`/.github/workflows/build.yml`)

Replace `library_name` and `LibraryName` below with your library name.

```yaml

## Continuous Deployment

There are two files you need for CD:

1. Create new versions/releases with Melos
2. Publish new releases to GitHub releases and pub.dev

### Create new versions with Melos (`/.github/workflows/create-release.yml`)

You can create new releases of your library with this workflow by going to the
"Actions" tab in your GitHub repo and manually starting this workflow with an
appropriate option. The options are:

- `--` -> call `melos version` with no additional parameters
- `--prerelease` -> create a prerelease version instead of normal release (e.g., `1.0.0-dev.0`)
- `--graduate` -> graduate a prerelease version to a normal release (e.g., `1.0.0-dev.0` becomes `1.0.0`)

You will need to set a repository secret of `BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` to your GitHub personal access token (PAT)
to allow for pushes to main from this Action.

Change `YourName` and `your-email@example.com` below as appropriate.

```yaml
name: Create Release(s)

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version_parameters:
        description: 'Parameters to pass to "melos version"'
        required: true
        default: " "
        type: choice
        options:
          - "--"
          - "--prerelease"
          - "--graduate"

jobs:
  create_release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Setup git
        run: |
          git config user.name "YourName"
          git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
      - uses: flutter-actions/setup-flutter@v4
      - uses: bluefireteam/melos-action@v2

      - name: Create the new version(s)
        run: melos version --yes ${{ inputs.version_parameters }}

      - name: Push created version commit
        run: git push
      - name: Push modified tags
        run: git push --tags
```

### Publish new releases to GitHub releases and pub.dev (`/.github/workflows/publish-release.yml`)

In order for this workflow to execute correctly and publish packages to pub.dev,
you need to have the contents of your pub credentials JSON file in a GitHub repo secret.

First you need to sign-in into your pub account locally by
running the following command: `dart pub login`.

After the authorization is completed, open the credentials file, which can be found:

- On Linux, at `~/.config/dart/pub-credentials.json`
- On macOS, at `~/Library/Application Support/dart/pub-credentials.json`
- On Windows, at `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\dart\pub-credentials.json`
  
And copy the contents of this `pub-credentials.json` file to a new GitHub repo secret named `PUB_CRED_JSON`.

This workflow is set to execute whenever new version tags are pushed up to GitHub.

```yaml
name: Publish Release(s)

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

jobs:
  publish_github_release:
    # macOS because we can cross-compile to all other platforms from it
    runs-on: macos-latest

      - uses: bluefireteam/melos-action@v2
      - name: Setup pub.dev credentials
        run: |
          mkdir -p $HOME/.config/dart
          cat << EOF > $HOME/.config/dart/pub-credentials.json
          ${{ secrets.PUB_CRED_JSON }}
          EOF
      - name: Dry-run publish to pub.dev
        run: melos publish -y --dry-run
      - name: Publish to pub.dev
        run: melos publish -y --no-dry-run
```
