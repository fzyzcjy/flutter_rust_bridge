# Who is using it

As an initial version of this page, I briefly list some very rough data here.

## Data from GitHub `dependents`: Open-source projects

:::caution
The lists below exclude *all* projects using the bridge if they are not open-source, which we know is a lot.
Therefore, the lists are very incomplete.
:::

I utilized the [GitHub "dependents" feature](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/network/dependents)
(note: use the dropdown at right-top to view dependents for each of the packages in this repository),
use some [scripts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58734176/how-to-use-github-api-to-get-a-repositorys-dependents-information-in-github)
to download it,
and temporarily filtered all repositories with >=3 stars (because they can be forks; this is super coarse and should be tuned later).

## Data from `pub.dev`: Open source non-app libraries

:::caution
Again, this excludes non-open-source projects.
Even more, this excludes all open source apps (as long as they are not *libraries*).
:::

Please directly visit the [the "dependency" search](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Aflutter_rust_bridge&sort=popularity)
page for results.
Since it has a nice GUI, there is no need to scrape and list here.

Remark: GitHub stars are surely not the only thing to measure a package.
For example, according to Dart pub.dev, many people are using [this package](https://pub.dev/packages/metadata_god)
that depends on flutter_rust_bridge (top 7% as of writing),
but [its GitHub](https://github.com/KRTirtho/metadata_god) only has <20 stars.

## Indirect data: Popularity in `pub.dev`

Given that there seems no way to directly provide a list of non-open-source projects,
here is another metric as a reference.

By [official definition](https://pub.dev/help/scoring), the "popularity" metric is:

> Popularity measures the number of apps that depend on a package over the past 60 days. We show this as a percentile from 100% (among the top 1% most used packages) to 0% (the least used package). We are investigating if we can provide absolute usage counts in a future version See this issue.
>
> Although this score is based on actual download counts, it compensates for automated tools such as continuous builds that fetch the package on each change request.

The value is `96%` as of writing.

Every metric has drawbacks. For example, see [this discussion](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dev/issues/2714).
