# Creating a new project

Start by creating a repository using the template from [flutter_rust_bridge_template]
and cloning it. This template is set up to be able to `flutter run` for most platforms
that Flutter supports.

(Remark: The template is created by [@Desdaemon](https://github.com/Desdaemon) who 
contributed many features into flutter_rust_bridge, instead of the creator of 
flutter_rust_bridge, [@fzyzcjy](https://github.com/fzyzcjy). Thus, it is not a typo to
see `Desdaemon` in the URL instead of `fzyzcjy` for that template repo.)
