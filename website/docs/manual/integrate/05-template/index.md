# Use code template to create new projects

:::info
This guide was written for flutter_rust_bridge v1, thus some content may be outdated.
The quickest approach to integrate is to follow the one-click approach in flutter_rust_bridge's quickstart page.

In this chapter, we are going to use create your own project from a code template. It seems a bit long, but it is just because we have tried to describe *every detail* that you may encounter.

**Remark:** Most complexity does *not* come from this library, `flutter_rust_bridge` - it is as same complex as using raw Dart/Flutter FFI with Rust. In other words, it is the Dart/Flutter + Rust toolchain that takes time to set up.
