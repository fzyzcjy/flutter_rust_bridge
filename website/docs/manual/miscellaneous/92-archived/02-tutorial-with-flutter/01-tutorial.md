# Tutorial: A Flutter+Rust app

In this tutorial, let us draw a [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) (a well-known infinite-resolution "image" generated by a simple math formula). The image is plotted in Flutter UI, generated by Rust algorithm, and communicated via this library.

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers `c` for which the function `f_c(z)=z^{2}+c` does not diverge to infinity when iterated from `z=0`. Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications.

## Get code

Please [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (optionally with [desktop support](https://flutter.dev/desktop) if you want to run app on desktop instead of cellphones), [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), and have some familiarity with them. Then get the example codebase:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge && cd flutter_rust_bridge/frb_example/with_flutter
```

## Optional: Run generator

This step is optional, since I have generated the source code already (in quickstart). Even if you do it, you should not see anything changed.

As soon as you make any modification to `api.rs`, you need to run codegen again. More information about requirements for code generation can be seen in the `Installing dependencies` section.

At this step you may need to `setup dependencies`.

## Run app

### Prelogue: Command details

The [CI workflow](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yaml) is useful if you want details of each command. The `flutter_android_test`, `flutter_ios_test`, `flutter_windows_test`, `flutter_macos_test` and `flutter_linux_test` demonstrates the exact commands needed to run this tutorial codebase from a brand new machine.

### Android app
See `Android setup`

### iOS app

Modify `Cargo.toml` to change `cdylib` to `staticlib`, then run `cargo lipo && cp target/universal/debug/libflutter_rust_bridge_example.a ../ios/Runner` to build Rust and copy the static library. Then run the Flutter app normally such as `flutter run`.

**Remark**: [This tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/q/69515032/4619958) will help you automatically execute `cargo` builds when building Flutter app.

### Windows app

Run it directly using `flutter run` assuming [Flutter desktop support](https://flutter.dev/desktop#set-up) has been configured. More details can be seen in [#66](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/issues/66).

### Linux app

Same as Windows. If you install Flutter through `snap`, please be wary of [#53](https://github.com/canonical/flutter-snap/issues/53).

### MacOS app

Same as Windows. (P.S. Under the hood, `cargo-xcode` is used to automate the process)

### Web (as a webpage)

Install `flutter_rust_bridge_serve` to simplify the process of building and serving a WASM binary.
See `Web setup` for more details.
