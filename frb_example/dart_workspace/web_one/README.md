A bare-bones Dart web app.

Uses [`package:web`](https://pub.dev/packages/web)
to interop with JS and the DOM.

## Running and building

To run the app,
activate and use [`package:webdev`](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev):

```
dart pub global activate webdev
webdev serve
```

To build a production version ready for deployment,
use the `webdev build` command:

```
webdev build
```
