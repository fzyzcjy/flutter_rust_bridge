# Tutorial: A Flutter+Rust app

In this tutorial, let us draw a [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), which is plotted in Flutter UI, generated by Rust algorithm, and communicated via this library.

<details>
<summary>(Click to see: What is a Mandelbrot set)</summary>

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers `c` for which the function `f_c(z)=z^{2}+c` does not diverge to infinity when iterated from `z=0`. Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications.

## Get example code

Please [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), and have some familiarity with them. Then get the example codebase:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge && cd flutter_rust_bridge/example/with_flutter
```

## Optional: Run code generator

This step is optional, since I have generated the source code already (in quickstart). Even if you do it, you should not see anything changed.

Firstly, you may need to install dependencies of this library:

* Install `cbindgen`: `cargo install cbindgen` <sub>(may [need latest version](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/issues/53#issuecomment-939588321), thanks @gmorenz)</sub>
* Install `ffigen`:  `dart pub global activate ffigen`, and [install LLVM](https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen#installing-llvm) which is required by `ffigen`.
* Install the codegen program: `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`.

Then, run the code generator:

```shell
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --rust-input frb_example/with_flutter/rust/src/api.rs --dart-output frb_example/with_flutter/lib/bridge_generated.dart --c-output frb_example/with_flutter/ios/Runner/bridge_generated.h
```

## Run app for various platforms

### Prelogue: Command details

The [CI workflow](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yaml) is useful if you want details of each command. The `flutter_android_test`, `flutter_ios_test`, `flutter_windows_test`, `flutter_macos_test` and `flutter_linux_test` demonstrates the exact commands needed to run this tutorial codebase from a brand new machine.

### Android

Run `cargo ndk -o ../android/app/src/main/jniLibs build`. Then run the Flutter app normally as is taught in official tutorial. For example, `flutter run`.

Remark: Since my quickstart app is so baremetal, I do not integrate the Rust building process into Flutter building process. But you can look at [this tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/q/69515032/4619958) to easily do that.

### iOS

Modify `Cargo.toml` to change `cdylib` to `staticlib`. (Again, this is baremetal example so it is done manually. For your project, you can automate it.)

Run `cargo lipo && cp target/universal/debug/libflutter_rust_bridge_example.a ../ios/Runner` to build Rust and copy the static library. Then run the Flutter app normally as is taught in official tutorial. For example, `flutter run`. (Similarly, [this tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/q/69515032/4619958) can automate the process.)

### Desktop (Windows/Linux/MacOS)

**Remark**: If you only want to develop a mobile app, skip this section - it is for creating desktop apps.

Run it directly using `flutter run` assuming [Flutter desktop support](https://flutter.dev/desktop#set-up) has been configured. 

#### Windows/Linux
This example (`frb_example/with_flutter`) already demonstrated how to integrate Cargo with CMake on Linux and Windows, and more details can be seen in [#66](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/issues/66).

#### MacOS

This is only *one* of the possible approaches. For example, [create new projects from a template](template.md) or [integrating with existing projects](integrate.md) discusses two other approaches.

To integrate a dynamic library to your macOS app, you need to configure your `Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Here, I show the instructions for Xcode 13.1:
1. Open the `yourapp/macos/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Drag your precompiled library (`libyourlibrary.dylib`) into `Runner/Frameworks`.
3. Click `Runner` (with a blue app store logo on the left, not the folder underneath) and go to the `Build Phases` tab.
    1. Drag `libyourlibrary.dylib` into the `Copy Bundle Resources` list.
    2. Under `Bundle Frameworks`, drag `libyourlibrary.dylib`  to the list, `Code sign on copy` should be checked by default.
    3. Under `Link Binary With Libraries`, set status of `libyourlibrary.dylib` to Optional. (We use dynamic linking, no need to statically link.)
4. Click `Runner` and go to the `General` tab.
    1. You should see `libyourlibrary.dylib` in the `Frameworks, Libararies and Embedded Content` list, with the option saying `Embed & Sign`.
    2. If not, drag your library to the list and select the option.
5. Click `Runner` and go to the `Build Settings` tab.
    1. In the `Search Paths` section configure the `Library Search Paths` to include the absolute path where libyourlibrary.dylib is located.

In `lib/main.dart`, you can now use `DynamicLibrary.open('libyourlibrary.dylib')` to dynamically link to the symbols. This example app shows how to do dynamic linking on other platforms as well so be sure to take a look at `frb_example/with_flutter/lib/main.dart`.
Reference the [flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/c-interop#compiled-dynamic-library-macos) for details, do note that the Xcode version they demonstrates in may not be the latest.
